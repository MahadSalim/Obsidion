Speculations made there was primitive monotheism before humans started to worship multiple deities.

The Sky God/ The heavens God is still a feature is religious life in many indigenous African tribes today.

Many anthropologists believe that this supreme dirty was eventually overshadowed by the more attractive gods of the pagan pantheons.

However there are still many theories about the origins of religion. So the above is still a speculation.

There is however a fact that human beings have always been interested in creating deities. 

***First known Deity*** : The Mother Goddess

The Mother Goddess was a prominent idol in the paleolithic period. People believed that the fertility that was transforming the human life was actually sacred. So they devised a God befitting this. She has been found in statues depicting her as a naked pregnant woman in regions like Europe, middle east and India. 

Also known as:
- Inanna (ancient sumeria)
- Isis (Egypt)
- Ishtar (Babylon)
- Anat (Canaan)
- Aphrodite (Greece)

Eventually, much like the first Sky God, she was also absorbed into later pantheons.
# **Ancient World of Mesopotamia**
---
Located near the Tigris-Euphrates valley there were inhabitants as early as 4000 BCE, known as the ***Sumerians***.

These are considered as one of the first people to build a proper civilization.

They were soon invaded by the ***Akkadians***.

Around 2000 BCE, came the ***Amorites***. They conquered the Sumerian - Akkadians civilizations and eventually made Babylon their capital. 

Finally came the ***Assyrians***, who had initially settled nearby but they eventually conquered Babylon.
## **The Great New Year Festival**
It was the most important festival of the Babylonians. Celebrated in the month of Nisan (April/May). 

The festivals main activities:
scapegoat being killed -> dethronement of the king -> public humiliation of the king -> 
finally enthroning the carnival king 

symbolized the events that occurred with the Gods, their story of their struggle against the primordial chaos.

4th day of festival: Priests and others gathered to recite ***Enuma Elish***

	 Enuma Elish was known as the epic poem which celebrated the victory of the gods over chaos
## **The Enuma Elish**
Story begins with the creation of the Gods. They emerged two by two from a formless, watery waste.  This waste was also considered divine. 

3 main Gods came from it: ***Apsu, Tiamat, Mummu***

Emanation occurred which resulted in a pantheon of Gods.

	Emanation is the process of something emerging from a source, without the source being diminished

The story goes that Apsu was cruel to his children, so ***Ea*** and the other gods challenged their parents. Ea was able to able to kill Apsu and Mummu but was too weak to overpower Tiamat. Ea had a child though, called ***Marduk***.  

	Ea was "The Earth God"
	Marduk was the "The Sun God"

Marduk wanted to become king of Gods and fought Tiamat and killed her. Eventually he split Timat's vast corpse into two. He so formed the arch of the sky & the world of men. This was the general story of the enuma elish and this is what the festival was about. Order had to reestablished every year to keep things in check. So marduk went to babylon and performed the rituals in the ziggurat. So the people of babylon had to keep up with traditions and honour the Gods by reminding themselves of the original struggle against chaos and to remind the king that he had to act justly and righteously like marduk did.

In the story of the enuma elish, Marduk actually created humanity from ***Kingu***. He killed him and from his divine blood mixed with the dust, he created the first man. 

	Kingu was the oafish consort of Tiamat who she created from the corpse of Apsu.
	This meant he was clumsy and intelligent and one of the most ineffectual gods.
